With a deadline of less than 24 hours, we had hundreds of people give this little story challenge a go. And in selecting our favourites, we were looking for stories that stood out for originality.

If YOUR story is one of the 30 listed below, congrats!
If you entered but didn’t make the list, also congrats for simply submitting a story (it might seem like a tiny thing, but putting even 30 words out there is great!).
Remember, this is a subjective process, so not being in the top 30 should definitely not squash your writing dreams!
Be sure to take a look at the stories listed and pick up anything that might be useful for your own writing.
AND if you love creative story challenges, our Furious Fiction competition takes place on the first Friday of every month – giving you the opportunity to win $500 from your 500-word story!
Okay, that’s enough chat. Enjoy!
